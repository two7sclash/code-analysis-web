# functional-pipeline

> Quickly chain method calls, property access and functions in natural left to right expression.

It is like [_.invoke](http://lodash.com/docs#invoke) + [_.pluck](http://lodash.com/docs#pluck) +
[_.compose](http://lodash.com/docs#compose) all rolled into single function.

Install and use under Node:

```
npm install functional-pipeline --save
var fp = require('functional-pipeline');
// or
global.fpDebug = true;
var fp = require('functional-pipeline');
// loads debug version of functional pipeline with
// stricter argument checking and better error reporting
```

Install and use in browser using bower:

```
bower install functional-pipeline
<script src="bower_components/functional-pipeline/dist/fp.js"></script>
// or
<script src="bower_components/functional-pipeline/dist/fp-debug.js"></script>
// attaches as window.fp object
```

## Example

Assuming this common code:

```js
function triple(x) { return 3 * x; }
function add2(x) { return x + 2; }
var data = {
  age: 10,
  getAge: function () { return this.age; }
};
```

You can express in single line

```js
var pipeline = fp('getAge', triple, add2);
```

what usually takes several compositions that are read from inside out

```js
function pipeline(obj) {
  return add2(triple(obj.getAge()));
}
```

You can even use nested paths using '.' separator

```js
var obj = {
  a: {
    b: {
      c: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
    }
  }
};
fp('a.b.c.1')(obj); // 'bar'
```

During runtime, detailed meta information is available in the `fp.version` object.

## Why?

Clear code is good code. Functional pipeline makes reading code slightly easier:

* Reading chained pipeline left to right is natural.
* Having no branches (they should be encapsulated inside functions) lowers complexity
* Composing multiple small functions makes code easier to test

I especially recommend using functional pipelines for callbacks,
replacing code with prebuilt and testable pipelines.

Example: lets sort objects in the collection by date nested 2 levels deep. This is
typical of the code arriving from the back end for example. Below
each operation I am showing its order in the callback function. The actual
argument name *item* does not matter.

```js
items = _.sortBy(items, function(item) {
  return new Date(item.latest_event.datetime);
  ------ --------      ------------ --------
     4      3                1         2
});
```

1. Grab `latest_event` property
2. Grab `datetime` property
3. Create `new Date` object from result of the previous step
4. Return the created date.

Reading the steps left to right starting in the middle, then switching
to reading them right to left going back at the start of the line is unnatural to me.
Here is the same sequence using *functional-pipeline*. The return operation is implicit.

```js
function newDate(a) { return new Date(a); }
items = _.sortBy(items, fp('latest_event', 'datetime', newDate));
                           --------------  ----------  -------
                                  1             2         3
```

We had to create a utility function *newDate* to get around JavaScript's `new` keyword.
You could use my [d3-helpers](https://github.com/bahmutov/d3-helpers) library that
provides both functional pipeline and a few small utility functions like `newDate`.

## Debug mode

Creating chains of calls dynamically using strings instead of
actual functions makes debugging harder. Functional pipeline has second implementation
with debugging turned on. This adds stringent checks before calling a method, or
executing a function or returning a non-existent property. For example:

### Checks during pipeline construction

*functional-pipeline debug* script first performs existance check during pipeline
construction, making sure every argument is either a string or a valid function.
If not, a detailed error message is thrown.

```js
global.fpDebug = true;
var fp = require('functional-pipeline');
var f = fp('foo', bar); // bar is non existent function
// throws right away
Error: Invalid arguments to functional pipeline - not a string or function
  0: string foo
  1: undefined argument
```

### Checks during pipeline execution

There are also checks during pipeline execution, throwing detailed error message
if something goes wrong. Both the pipeline setup and the original object is
in the exception's message in addition to the immediate error cause.

```js
var obj = {
  bar: {
    baz: 'baz'
  }
};
var pipeline = fp('bar', 'foo');
pipeline(obj);

Error: Cannot use property foo from object {
  "baz": "baz"
}
pipeline
  0: string bar
  1: string foo
original object
{
  "bar": {
    "baz": "baz"
  }
}
```

## Inspiration

I was inspired by [l33teral](https://github.com/nicholascloud/l33teral) library for
convenient access to properties deep inside object hierarchy. My second inspiration
was [Make tests read like a book](http://uxebu.com/blog/2013/01/08/make-tests-read-like-a-book/) by
Wolfram Kriesing.
